        foods, and still love some of the sweetest dishes. Let's first take a look at some of the spicy foods Bengalis and Indians love to eat.

   <img src = "ChickenCurry.jpg" class = "float" alt = "Chicken Curry" height = "150px" width = "180px";>
   <p>Chicken Curry is not only made amongst a majority of Bengali families, it is also made among many Indian families. In India, Punjabis,Assamese, Kashmiri,
       Rajasthani, and Meghalayan Cultures, for a few examples, are where meat is mainly eaten. Otherwise, many Indian Subcultures are all vegetarian due to the 
        high beliefs and regards for animals in Hinduism and the slight variations in them. Bengalis, especially Bengalis who are also Muslim, eat meat as well, but they
        need to be halal, i.e. Sacrificed in the name of Allah. Bengalis and Indians do not eat pork due to individual religious and spiritual beliefs. The recipe listed below
        is a very generic chicken recipe that many people can use if they crave Chicken Curry.<br></p>

    <p>Eggs on the other hand are only eaten by nonvegetarian Indians and Bengalis. In Hinduism and Sikhism, many refrain from eating eggs due to religious beliefs
